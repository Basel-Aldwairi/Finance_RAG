Transfer Safety Tips | Bank al Etihad - Jordan
When you get payment details for a new account or see any changes or red flags in payment information, make sure to double-check them directly with the payee.This is crucial, especially if it's a new payee, a different bank, or an unexpected country!
Fraudsters often create a sense of urgency to manipulate victims. If you receive a transfer request that’s unexpected or urgent, take a moment to evaluate the situation before proceeding.
