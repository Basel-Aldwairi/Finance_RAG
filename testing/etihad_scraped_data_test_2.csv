Can I get a loan, if I don't live in Jordan?
Yes, if you're an expat and thinking of buying a home in Jordan, we've got you covered. To get started, you'll need to share a few documents.
If you live in the Gulf, we'll ask for your salary slips, a bank statement from the last 6 months, and a certified credit report from your country of residence. If you're a foreign national living in the United States, just send us your latest tax return.
You'll also need to sign the CRIF approval form and provide a certified copy of your ID, passport, or residence permit.
Eligibility:
Minimum monthly salary: 350 JOD
Minimum age requirement: 21 years old
Payments
By taking out a housing loan, your payments will be automatically deducted from your monthly salary for the duration of the loan.
It is important to understand the ins and outs of your housing loan, so please make sure you read the Terms & Conditions document you receive at a branch before you apply or
get in touch
to know more.
How is interest charged?
The interest is calculated on a reducing basis starting from 7.00%.

Customer Service through the app is absolutely useless. The msgs disappear, are hard to attach screenshots to, and hard to follow up on. Also, many problems with the bank's multicurrency cards, do NOT rely on them ever if you are travelling and try to have backup cards and backup bank accounts with better international support.

We're sorry to hear that, but we're pretty sure we can help! Shoot us an email at appstore@bankaletihad.com with more details on the problem, along with your full name and contact information and our team will be in touch to resolve the issue.
decent bank app but every time you format your phone or get a new phone you have to ask support to remove used devices cus you'll get something like "" you have reached maximum allowed devices "" so annoying and their dumb customer support excuse is "" its for security "" even though they still use sms for 2fa 😂

Hello, We are sorry to hear that! but we sure can help, please contact our representatives on 065600444 or via live chat on the app and we'll be more than happy to help you out !🧡
The app is full of bugs and issues, each time I communicate with their call center they keep telling me that they fixed those issues, anyhow the bank keep adding and implementing new features while most of them are not working well, you just keep hanging with your money as stocks or gold or whatever without getting a hold of it and just feel stranded. even Bank Etihad call center won't answer any more, I've tried to call them multiple times for hours in the last couple of days with no answer.

The Best Banking Application!
This app has completely changed my life and made it simpler. With just a few steps I was able to open a digital bank account easily. The best part about it that it does not take much time and does not require you to visit a branch. Additionally my ATM card arrived to my doorstep in less than 48 hours. Thank you for this amazing customer service and thank you for reaching out to me to ensure that everything was sorted out and no further help was needed! Bank Al-Etihad is miles ahead of other banks and the future of banking looks promising :)

Best banking application ever
I thought I was using the best banking app which was for the Arabi-Mobile app which is for the Arab Bank. But luckily I changed my account to Bank Al Etihad and this application  literally redefined the Banking Application. No need to issue an internet card, you can activate or deactivate you card within the application. Not only you can predefine the billers but the app will notifies you for any outstanding bill with much much easier way to pay. Analysis for all your bills, you can set a credit limit for your card and much more. Thank you Al Etihad Bank.

Highly satisfied and impressed of the banker and her service
I came today to open a saving account for its eithad bank. Miss Anoud Halaseh was the one who helped me out, as I noticed, she ha one of a few bankers I dealt with in the past several years that does her job well and complete with good smile and confidence . She takes her job duties seriously and applies motivation and positive tips to it. She is great on building trust and respect between her and her client. Her work station is clean and decent looking. I left with satisfied and impressed of this good face of Etihad Bank. Best of luck to her and her team.

We’re courageous by nature. We didn’t get where we are today by following the herd. We relentlessly look for new business opportunities, markets, and ideas. When we recognize that spirit in others, we’re prepared to back them up.
Always learning
The financial landscape is in a constant state of flux. We’re always looking to expand our knowledge and use new technologies to evolve and grow with it. We’re just as passionate about sharing what we learn.
Championing creativity
We understand the impact art and culture play in helping us grow as individuals and communities. The more we embrace them, the more we increase our imaginations. This allows us to dig deeper, to approach traditional problems from fresh perspectives, and uncover what makes a business or investment truly special.

Working with young people
We want to empower young people, and help them make the best choices for their futures. Everyone deserves a chance to do their best, regardless of background or family income.
Championing Jordan’s entrepreneurs
Jordan is full of talented people who can shape the world around us, and we want them to be the best they can be. That’s why we’ll always champion business and enterprise, from young startups to seasoned entrepreneurs.
Arts and culture
Ideas and creative expression are how we progress. It’s important for us to keep craft and artisanship in Jordan thriving, so we do all we can to support new talents and local projects.

Why work for us?
Join our family and shape the future with us.
What started out as a family business aiming to create a movement in the world of finance, has evolved into Jordan’s most client-centric bank. We believe in the intrinsic value of human connection, and have fully adopted and embodied this belief without exceptions, allowing us to make our mark on the industry and around us.
Human behavior is contagious, and we choose to spread the principles of humility and interconnectivity to our employees first and foremost, later reaching out to each and every customer.
Our ever-evolving journey has taught us that we must continue to pursue all that is new and innovative, keeping our entrepreneurial and creative spirit alive. We maintain our position as lifelong learners and not only urge, but support our entire Bank al Etihad family to do the same; be daring, instigate real and lasting change, and then share all that you’ve achieved with those around you.
We’re hiring talented, ambitious, and forward-looking individuals to help build the bank that is shaping the future. Become a part of our family, and
apply now.

Extraordinary General Assembly Meeting Conclusion
Bank al Etihad held its Extraordinary General Assembly Meeting on 25/06/2025, with a shareholder attendance rate of 92.79%.
Bank al Etihad and InvestBank have received shareholder approval to proceed with a landmark merger — the largest of its kind in the country’s banking history. The agreement, approved by the extraordinary general assemblies of both banks on 25 June 2025, marks the beginning of formal regulatory procedures that will see Bank al Etihad acquire 100% ownership of INVESTBANK in a share-based transaction.
Under the terms of the agreement, all shares constituting INVESTBANK’s capital will be transferred to Bank al Etihad, in exchange for in-kind shares that Bank al Etihad will issue and allocate to INVESTBANK’s shareholders. With shareholder approval secured, the transaction is now in effect and will proceed within the required regulatory framework, subject to final clearance from the Central Bank of Jordan, the Companies Control Department, the Jordan Securities Commission, and the Securities Depository Center.
